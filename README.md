# Sales-Report-Dashboard
Power BI Sales Report Dashboard

Overview: I have created 4 KPI's, 1 Pie Chart, 1 Line Chart, 1 Funnel Chart, 1 Map and lastly 1 Donut Chart.

The 4 KPI's are about:
i)Total Sales.
ii)Total Profit.
iii)Total Quantity.
iv)Total Discount.

The Pie Chart indicates Sum of Sales by Segments. The Line Chart indicates Sum of Sales by Order Date. The Funnel Chart is indicating Sales by Sub-Category. The Map is showing us Sales by different Sates. And lastly the Donut Chart is showing us Sales by Regions.
